We know the Russians are preparing a counter-attack. Our goal is to slow down enemy operations long enough to prepare for the onslaught.
<br>
Their tanks are in place, but without fuel. So if we can cut off their fuel supplies, the Reds won't have a chance to use their main forces.
<br>
I've got two targets: first, a fuel station in Dourdan. Second - a convoy moving to the south.
<br>
Oh, and Intel reported something about convoy. Apparently, there should be only one fuel truck, and it should be at the end. The fuel is my objective - I'm here to take out that truck, and don't need to bother destroying any other vehicles.
