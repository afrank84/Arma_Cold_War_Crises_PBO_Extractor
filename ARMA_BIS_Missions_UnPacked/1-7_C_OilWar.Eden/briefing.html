<B>Feb 26, 1985</B> – Our tanks are running on empty.
<br><br>
We desperately need fuel for the T55s, and the quickest way to get some is to take it from the enemy. Our original plan was simply to destroy this convoy on the small road to the South, but situation is bad. There's a temporary enemy camp near here. Yes, there'll be a lot of Russians. But we need that fuel urgently.
<br><br>
One thing to remember: fuel is flammable. Any explosion will destroy whole base. Including the fuel...

We need fuel for our tanks. The aim of this mission is to destroy the convoy and conquer the enemy fuel base.
<br><br>
We are <A HREF="marker:Start">near the coast</A>, to the east from Levie at 8:15AM.

</p>

<p><a name = "OBJ_2"></a>After that, immediately transport your squad to <A HREF="marker:target">the Russian fuel base </A>and occupy it. BE CAREFUL! Don't destroy it. We need that fuel. And keep a look out - if the Russians flee, they will probably return with reinforcements...
